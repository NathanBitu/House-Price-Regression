# House Price Regression

Welcome to the House Price Regression project! This is a machine learning model that predicts the value of residential properties based on various factors such as location, size, and other relevant features. In this repository, you will find everything you need to train and test the model, as well as some additional tools and resources to help you get started.

## Getting Started

To understand the project, you will need to have some knowledge of machine learning and data analysis. You will also need to have Python 3.x installed on your system, along with the following libraries:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- xgboost

## Data

The data used in this project is a sample dataset from the [Kaggle House Prices competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). It includes information on the sale prices and features of residential properties in Ames, Iowa. We have preprocessed and cleaned the data to make it easier to use, but you can also explore the original dataset if you're interested.

## Model

TBD

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the model, we have used various metrics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared. We have also plotted some data visualizations to help you understand the relationships between the features and the target variable. You can use these tools to evaluate the model's performance on your own data.

## Conclusion

We hope you find this House Price Regression project useful and informative. Please feel free to explore the code and data, and make any modifications or improvements you see fit. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact us. Happy coding!
